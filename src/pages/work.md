Hey I'm Roman Munar. I'm a self-taught software developer and has been working professionally for &gt;3 years. On the side, I help debug and critique projects on several developer social learning groups and also likes to dabble with UI design and UX to some extent for my side projects.

### Values and expectations working with me

- #### An Independent self-managing developer
  - I've been working with companies as a contractor and small organizations as a freelancer since the beginning of my career.
  - I know when to make decisions independently and when to ask for additional question or help.
- #### Effective and transparent Communication
  - I've worked with developers who are not inline with the bigger picture sweating over minute technical details. I make sure that everyone on the team are doing something that's worth their time.
  - I make sure to check in with someone when they're having a hard time figuring out a problem or if they're being inconsistent.
- #### Being pragmatic and delivering features quickly
  - I know how crucial it is to quickly iterate a product and to deliver solutions fast.
  - I'm an opinionated developer. I know what tools/frameworks to reach out for.
  - I also model the software exactly as how the business operates. This allows fluid communication within the team, avoids tech debt, and unnecessary boilerplate.

### Now

- Building Prioritizer.
- Building Pinoy who codes.
- Improving this site.
- Automating things with zx and puppeteer

### My Goto Tech Stack

These Tech are my staples. I use them on my projects daily. I tend to reach out for small and modular solutions that does one thing and one thing well. This is what I love about the NodeJS ecosystem. The continuous improvements and new ideas to ease software development with very low compromises.

- #### GraphQL

  - GraphQL is an integral part for most of my projects. It allows me to create a type-safe api and since I use Typescript this means that that I get to have full type-safety from backend to frontend.

  - Tools: GraphQL-Yoga, Codegen, Helix, and either Nexus/PothosQL

- #### Typescript

  - _All_ of my projects are written in Typescript. There have been a lot of improvements with its hot reload hardly noticable delay. I use Vite an easily customizable bundler that offers ESM and Typescript support out-of-the-box.

- #### ReactJS/NextJS

  - NextJS is my goto `React` framework right now. It offers many features for improving the DX and performance of the project. Image optimization, has all types of rendering, Typescript, File-based routing, i18n, and much more out-of-the-box.
  - I haven't had the time to check out Remix. So for now I'm keeping my eye out for it.

- #### Tailwind CSS/Material UI

  - I use `Tailwind CSS` for projects that already has a design in place. Prioritizing customizability, and flexibility.
  - I reach out for `Material UI` when I'm the only one working with the design and development of the product, or projects that needs design on-the-fly.

- #### NestJS + PostgreSQL + Prisma

  - This backend stack allows me to create type-safe APIs and do system design with very low boilerplate.
  - I'd also use NestJS for projects where `Domain Modeling` is a warranted system design.

- #### More stuff I use
  - **Testing**
    - Jest integration testing
    - Cypress E2E testing
    - MSW client-only network testing.
  - **Environemnt**
    - VSCode, Linux/Bash, Docker, and zx.
  - **In development**
    - Redux toolkit, styled-components, Svelte
    - NestJS, Express, Fastify
